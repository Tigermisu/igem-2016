                    Science is not only about laboratory work or projects, but also context in social, geographical and global aspects. Synthetic Biology as a multidisciplinary science gathers different persons, scientists, and individuals. Therefore, it is essential to
                    evaluate the circumstances at which every scientific project is developed, having in mind the responsibility that it carries. <br/> <br/> The implications of Synthetic Biology (hereinafter also referred to as SB)
                    have repercussions from the Ethical, Economical and Legal perspectives. Our team analyzed said perspectives with a focus on the Latin-American dimension, for the diffusion of SB in the light of a responsible progress.

                        The <strong>ethical</strong> approach focuses on the openness issue: the paradigms of exclusivity and attributions, its relation to the intellectual property (IP) system; the democratic and modular nature of SB; advancement and
                        its implications concerning security.

                        The <strong>Legal</strong> analysis focuses on the persistent need for an effective regulation of SB at international, regional and local level. The main legal aspects concerning SB regard the application of the IPR system, the
