                        <p>I am a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering . Although I have  participated in other competitions,  iGEM is the first scientific competition in which I participated since I began studying at Tec. I am violinist and I have many other hobbies but I enjoy them even more when I can share them with people I love as my boyfriend, family, friends and of course the iGEM team :)  I'm excited to be part of such an amazing team! </p>

A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person and I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are going to the gym, reading everything  that I find interesting, watching series, and listening to dope music.  I love doing labwork and everything that's involved with it.</p>

I'm really thankful that I'd been chosen to work on this project because it helped me realized that i wasn't wrong by choosing this major, plus now I get along with way more people at my college. I love all types of art especially music and drawing, making jokes and laughing out loud. Needless to say I love Adele and The Joker. </p>
