                        <p>Hi! I´m a Venezuelan student getting a biotechnology major in Mexico. I´m glad to join Myxo project Chihuahua, this team is a family for me. Besides, it gives me the opportunity to carry out my dream: do something to help people around the world. I love to learn new stuff, have fun and share with people I love; for these reasons I´m happy to be an iGEM member.</p>
                        <p class="meta">>Ricardo is the second in command, always attentive to the needs and priorities of the team. We call him #Venezuela, because he’s the only foreign member on the team (he has introduced us to a lot of weird words) #CamburMan #Vaguada #Macundal #Cotufa #QuanticArepa</p>

                        <p>As all of my team members I’m currently studying Biotechnology Engineering, more specifically I’m 19 years old and about to start my third semester. I’m really thankful that I’d been chosen to work on this project because it helped me realized that i wasn't wrong by choosing this major, plus now I get along with way more people at my college. I love all types of art especially music and drawing, making jokes and laughing out loud. Needless to say I love Adele and The Joker.</p>
                        <p class="meta">>Joel is part of the Human Practices division, always ready to party and good at questioning if the procedures are all right. He is also a key member on our field trips.

                        <p>I am a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering . Although I have  participated in other competitions,  iGEM is the first scientific competition in which I participated since I began studying at Tec. I am violinist and I have many other hobbies but I enjoy them even more when I can share them with people I love as my boyfriend, family, friends and of course the iGEM team :)  I'm excited to be part of such an amazing team! </p>
