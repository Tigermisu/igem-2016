                        <p>I am a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering. Although I have participated in other competitions,  iGEM is the first scientific competition in which I participate since I began studying at Tec. I am violinist and I have many other hobbies, but I enjoy them even more when I can share them with people I love. I'm excited to be part of such an amazing team! </p>

A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person and I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are going to the gym, reading everything that I find interesting, watching series, and listening to dope music. I love doing labwork and everything that's involved with it.</p>
