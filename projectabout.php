            <p class="margin attention left">The first idea we had was the measurement of bioluminescence by means of a biosensor; but this project was so simple we decided it wasn’t what we wanted. Then we thought about the production of penicillin using fibroblasts; and though we did a lot of research, we discarded this idea because of the complex metabolic route the production of this antibiotic implied.</p>

        <p class="margin attention left">On April 1, we decided to change our project. We realized that working with L-DOPA was a viable option. This new project had the purpose of producing dopamine in fibroblasts and creating a biosensor that could help us to quantify the amount of dopamine excreted from the body, in order to detect Parkinson’s disease in an early stage. As the time passed by, we noticed that the measurement of this neurotransmitter was quite difficult because we needed to get dopamine specifically from the central nervous system, but we found out that the dopamine excreted from the body comes along with the dopamine from the peripheral nervous system. We tried to find a solution to this problem by looking for metabolites excreted only by the central nervous system. However, we slowly gave up on this project because we weren’t able to find a way to continue with it. At this point, we were quite disappointed because we didn't knew whether to keep on with this project or to start with another one. We had already discarded a lot of ideas and did a lot of research with each one. We took some time to think about this problem, and finally we decided to change the project.</p>

        <p class="margin attention left">The team agreed to continue with a project that consisted in the use of myxobacteria to attack fungus and termites found in wood that's mainly used for construction. Nevertheless, we decided to change the project one more time because we realized that there were already a lot of products for this purpose in the market; and it wouldn’t be easy to beat them.</p>
        <p class="margin attention left">In spite of that, the project wasn't completely changed because we were still going to use myxobacteria but this time for fighting fungus found in distinct crops, especially alfalfa because this is a local problem.</p>

        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
        <p class="attention left">Environmental issues derive from the development of chemical products that achieve their purposes but can cause damage in long term. Therefore, the need of more specific and eco-friendly solutions arises. Synthetic biology allows us to enhance useful properties on organisms such as bacterias.</p>
